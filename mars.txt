Holy frak! I love mars!

I like mars. it is pretty.
However I do not want to live there as the atmosphere is too thin.
Long days and sleepless nights.
The long nights are making me not a little unstable and filled with 
ennui.
During the night the sands seem to... almost scream in the wind. I 
suppose it is just the wind buffeting the different kinds of sand.
